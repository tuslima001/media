    <h1> <b></b>Bangladesh</b></h1>
    <p>
        Our Country Bangladesh is my motherland. She came into being in 1971. Her land area is 1,47,570 square miles. About 16 crore people live here. There are sixty-four districts and eight divisions in my motherland. The main occupation of the people is agriculture. They grow jute, rice, sugarcane, potatoes and various kinds of vegetables in plenty. Our mother tongue is Bangla. We speak, write, sing and dance in Bangla. Her people are very simple and peace-loving. They are patriots too. They love independence. I am proud of being a citizen of a country like Bangladesh.
